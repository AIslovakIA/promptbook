-   MODEL NAME `gpt-4` (requested `gpt-4`)

### Prompt

```
Compare meaning of thee two sentences:

## Sentence 1:

> The cat gracefully prowled through the room, showcasing its innate feline elegance.

## Sentence 2:

> The gracefully prowled through the room, showcasing its innate feline elegance.
```

### Result

```
Sentence 1 depicts a scenario where a cat is walking through a room in a graceful and elegant manner, reflecting its inherent qualities typically associated with felines.

Sentence 2 appears to have a missing subject as "The" requires specification. It seems the sentence is trying to depict a similar scenario as Sentence 1 but the omission of "cat" yields it incomprehensible as is.
